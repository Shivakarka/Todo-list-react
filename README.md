# Problem Statement

Create an offline TODO App for the browser using React JS.

<br>

# Features Required

- A simple input bar to add Todo(s) on pressing the return key.
- A list of TODO cards where each todo is appended on creation.
- Clicking on a TODO card should mark the TODO as complete.
- A reset button on the top right corner of the App to clear all Todo(s) and return to the initial state.
- Hitting the refresh button (including hard refresh) in the browser should not cause
any change in the state of the app (it should work like a regular offline app).

# Steps Required to view the project locally on browser.
- Download zip or clone the repo using git command
- Run npm install command to install required dependencies
- Run npm start to view the web page locally at  http://localhost:3000 in the browser
